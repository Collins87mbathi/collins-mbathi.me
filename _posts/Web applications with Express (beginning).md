# Introduction

Express is a lightweight and adaptable Node.js web application framework that offers a comprehensive set of features for developing web applications.

## GETTING STARTED

You must first create a directory, navigate to it in your shell, and then install Express with npm by running `npm install express â€”save`.

Make a file called index.js and add the following code to it, which will create an Express server and add one endpoint to it with the app.get method:

```JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
 response.send('hello World');
});
app.listen(5000, 'localhost');


```
Use the following command in your shell to run your command script:

```JavaScript
node app.js
```
On port.0, your application will accept connections. If the hostname argument to `app.listen` is not specified, the server will accept connections on both the machine's IP address and localhost. If a port value is 0, the operating system will assign a port that is available.

Once your script is up and running, you can run it in a shell to ensure that you get the expected "Hello World" response from the server:

```JavaScript
curl http://localhost:5000
Hello World

```
